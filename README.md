# Song-Track
[View Application](http://xiaomin-chen.com/coding-project/song-track-finder/song-track-finder.html)

A program that searches a song link and image using last.fm and spotify API.

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, jQuery, last.fm API

The last.fm API is used to provide track link on last.fm website while spotify API is used to display the corresponding album image.
Note that last.fm restricted client access to the image of their tracks, which is the reason behind using spotify API instead.
